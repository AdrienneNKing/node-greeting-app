1) a Node module is a set of functions you want to include in your Node application
2) The main difference between exports and module.exports is that module.exports is the variable itself(returned from require()), and can be reassigned outside of the module, while exports(a reference to module.exports) cannot. 
3) Because exports cannot be reassigned it is recommended to use exports unless you want to have your module be a specific object type.
